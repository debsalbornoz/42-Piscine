# 42-Piscine-Sp

Here are the projects I completed during the tryout process at "école 42" in São Paulo, Brazil. These projects were completed using the C language, and in most cases, we were required to recreate a function from scratch, reproducing its behavior without being able to use the original function. This approach required us to have a deep understanding of how the functions worked.
