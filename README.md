# 42-Piscine-Sp

These are my projects from tryout process at "école 42" based in São Paulo, Brasil. We used the C language in this project and in most exercises of the project list we had to recreate a function from scratch, reproducing the behavior of the original function without being able to use it. That way, to recreate the functions it is necessary to deeply understand their operation. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (:
